###Description
Mazes:
One of the most basic kinds of games that we can represent in software is a maze. A maze is defined as a rectangular grid (n by m) of cells. Each cell has between 1 and 3 walls. Also, the walls at the outside cells (along the top, left, right and bottom of the maze) are closed. A cell that has 4 walls is a dead end and one that has zero walls of course floats and has no impact.

use ``ruby run.rb`` to start the program

###Commands

***exit***
exit program

***redesign***
reset all the cells and walls and come up with a random new maze of the same size. 

***load***
``load(arg)`` load a specific customized maze
you should represent it as a 0-1 string
e.g.
+-+-+-+-+
|   |   |
+-+ + + +
|   | | |
+ +-+ + +
|     | |
+-+ +-+ +
|     | |
+-+-+-+-+

which is equal to

111111111
100010001
111010101
100010101
101110101
100000101
111011101
100000101
111111111

so represent it as a string:
"111111111100010001111010101100010101101110101100000101111011101100000101111111111"

***display***
prints a diagram of the maze on the console.

***solve***
``solve(begX, begY, endX, endY)`` method that determines if thereâ€™s a way to walk from a specified beginning position to a specified ending position. return false if there is now way.

***trace***
``trace(begX, begY, endX, endY)`` method that is just like ``solve()`` but traces the positions that the solution visits.
